       " 'Some however have already gained publicity through the papers and others have not offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so high a degree and which it is the object of these papers to illustrate',\n",
       " 'Some too have baffled his analytical skill and would be as narratives beginnings without an ending while others have been but partially cleared up and have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and sur mise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to him',\n",
       " 'There is however one of these last which was so remark able in its details and so startling in its results that I am tempted to give some account of it in spite of the fact that there are points in connection with it which never have been and probably never will be entirely cleared up',\n",
       " 'The year 87 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or less interest of which I retain the records',\n",
       " 'Among my headings under this one twelve months I find an account of the adventure of the Paradol Chamber of the Amateur Mendicant Society who held a luxurious club in the lower vault of a furniture warehouse of the facts connected with the loss of the British bark Sophy Anderson of the singular adventures of the Grice Patersons in the island of Uffa and finally of the Camberwell poisoning case',\n",
       " 'In the latter as may be remembered Sherlock Holmes was able by winding up the dead man s watch to prove that it had been wound up two hours before and that therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time a deduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case',\n",
       " 'All these I may sketch out at some future date but none of them present such singular features as the strange train of circum stances which I have now taken up my pen to describe',\n",
       " 'It was in the latter days of September and the equinoctial gales had set in with exceptional violence',\n",
       " 'All day the wind had screamed and the rain had beaten against the windows so that even here in the heart of great hand made London we were forced to raise our minds for the instant from the routine of life and to recognize the presence of those great elemental forces which shriek at mankind through the bars of his civilization like untamed beasts in a cage',\n",
       " 'As evening drew in the storm grew higher and louder and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in the chimney',\n",
       " 'Sherlock Holmes sat moodily at one side of the fireplace cross indexing his records of crime while I at the other was deep in one of Clark Russell s fine sea stories until the howl of the gale from without seemed to blend with the text and the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves',\n",
       " 'My wife was on a visit to her mother s and for a few days I was a dweller once more in my old quarters at Baker Street',\n",

       " 'But I take it that it is more likely to be some crony of the landlady s',\n",
       " 'Sherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture however for there came a step in the passage and a tapping at the door',\n",
       " 'He stretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and towards the vacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit',\n",
       " 'Come in said he',\n",
       " 'The man who entered was young some two and twenty at the outside well groomed and trimly clad with something of refine ment and delicacy in his bearing',\n",
       " 'The streaming umbrella which he held in his hand and his long shining waterproof told of the fierce weather through which he had come',\n",
       " 'He looked about him anxiously in the glare of the lamp and I could see that his face was pale and his eyes heavy like those of a man who is weighed down with some great anxiety',\n",
       " 'l owe you an apology he said raising his golden pince nez to his eyes',\n",

       " 'He had made a very considerable fortune in the States and his reason for leaving them was his aversion to the negroes and his dislike of the Republican policy in extend ing the franchise to them',\n",
       " 'He was a singular man fierce and quick tempered very foul mouthed when he was angry and of a most retiring disposition',\n",
       " 'During all the years that he lived at Horsham I doubt if ever he set foot in the town',\n",
       " 'He had a garden and two or three fields round his house and there he would take his exercise though very often for weeks on end he would never leave his room',\n",

       " 'He begged my father to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in his way',\n",
       " 'When he was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me and he would make me his representative both with the servants and with the tradespeople so that by the time that I was sixteen I was quite master of the house',\n",
       " 'I kept all the keys and could go where I liked and do what I liked so long as I did not disturb him in his privacy',\n",
       " 'There was one singular exception however for he had a single room a lumber room up among the attics which was invariably locked and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to enter',\n",
